# Parallel-SGD
Parallel implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent using SciKit-Learn library in Python.

Please see [Benchmark notebook](https://github.com/angadgill/Parallel-SGD/blob/master/Benchmark.ipynb) for characterization of 5 techniques showing their speed-up and accuracy. PSGD5, based on ['Hogwild!'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5730), performs the best with no loss of accuracy. 

This project is a work-in-progress for a feature request on SciKit-Learn: [#1174](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1174)
